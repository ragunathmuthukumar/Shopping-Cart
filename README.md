# Shopping Cart Application

   * A Java-based shopping cart application that integrates with a Price API to calculate cart totals with tax.

## Overview

   * This project provides a robust shopping cart implementation with price retrieval, validation, error handling, and tax calculation capabilities. The application integrates with an external Price API to fetch product prices and calculate cart totals.

## Features

   - Add items to cart with quantity management
   - Retrieve product prices from Price API
   - Automatic subtotal and tax calculation
   - Duplicate item quantity aggregation
   - Comprehensive input validation
   - Robust error handling
   - Extensive unit test coverage

## Technologies Used

   - **Java** - Core programming language
   - **Gradle** - Build automation tool
   - **JUnit 5** - Testing framework
   - **Java HTTP Client** - API communication
   - **Jackson** - JSON parsing and serialization

## Validation Rules

### Product Name Validation
   - Must not be null or empty
   - Cannot contain forbidden special characters: `/ \ ? % # * : < > | "`

### Cart Item Validation
   - Quantity must be greater than 0

## Error Handling

   * The application includes three custom exception types:

     - `InvalidCartItemException` - Thrown for invalid product names or quantities
     - `ProductNotFoundException` - Thrown when a product is not available in the Price API
     - `PriceClientException` - Thrown for malformed JSON or network issues during API calls

## Available Products

   - `cheerios`
   - `cornflakes`
   - `frosties`
   - `shreddies`
   - `weetabix`

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd shopping-cart

2. **Build the project**
    gradle build

3. **Run tests**
    gradle test

## Usage Example
    Adding Items to Cart q
    
    ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();
    
    // Add 1 × cornflakes @ 2.52 each
    cart.addItem("cornflakes", 1);
    
    // Add another 1 × cornflakes @ 2.52 each
    cart.addItem("cornflakes", 1);
    
    // Add 1 × weetabix @ 9.98 each
    cart.addItem("weetabix", 1);

## Expected Results
    Cart contains 2 × cornflakes
    Cart contains 1 × weetabix
    Subtotal = 15.02
    Tax = 1.88
    Total = 16.90
    
## Price API Integration
    The application integrates with an external Price API that returns product price details based on the product name. The API provides:  
    Product name
    Unit price

## Testing
    The project includes comprehensive unit tests covering:  
    Valid cart operations
    Invalid product names
    Invalid quantities
    Product not found scenarios
    API error handling
    Tax calculation accuracy
    
## Tax Calculation
    Tax rate: 12.5%
    Tax is calculated on the subtotal and item level
    Final total = Subtotal + Tax
